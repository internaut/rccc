Resistor Color Code Calculator website with HTML5 / Javascript code. See it online at http://proj.mkonrad.net/rccc/.

Description
===========

This is the code of the website http://proj.mkonrad.net/rccc/ which features an online tool to to interactivly calculate the resistance of a resistor by choosing the color codes or vice versa by entering the resistance and getting displayed the right color code.
This tool also supports E-Series (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_number#E_series).

Technical details
=================

I've used only HTML5 and CSS for the layout and style, no graphics are used besides the favicon.
For interactivity I've used JavaScript in conjunction with the great jQuery framework (http://jquery.com/).
